# LifeMon

LifeMon is an innovative concept where we transform real-life objects into Pokémon-like creatures called Lifemons. Players can upload pictures of objects, and through AI, those images are converted into custom Pokémon that can be used to build teams and battle against others.


## How do you build it

1- install the dependencies with `npm i`
2- run the app with `npm run dev`
